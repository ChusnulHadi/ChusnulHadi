A Full-Stack Developer and an Network Engineer based in Tulungagung, East Java

## Full-Stack Developer

As a full stack developer, you need to master almost all aspects of application and web development. Following are some of the things I mastered while becoming a full stack developer.

### Programming Languange

Typescript and Javascript are the main programming languages â€‹â€‹I use. Using this programming language can make it easier and faster to develop applications on both the frontend and backend sides.

### UI/UX Designer

As a skilled UX/UI designer, I leverage Figma to craft intuitive and visually appealing interfaces for my projects. My expertise, honed through the Skilvul UI/UX Design Master program, encompasses the entire design process, from empathizing with users to testing prototypes. This comprehensive approach ensures that my designs meet both functional and aesthetic requirements.

### Frontend

![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-61dafb?style=for-the-badge&logo=React&logoColor=black) ![nextjs](https://img.shields.io/badge/nextjs-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=Next.js) ![expo](https://img.shields.io/badge/expo-000020?style=for-the-badge&logo=expo) ![tailwind](https://img.shields.io/badge/tailwindcss-06b6d4?style=for-the-badge&logo=tailwindcss&logoColor=white)

React is a versatile JavaScript library that empowers developers to create a wide range of applications, including web, cross-platform mobile, and desktop experiences. Its component-based architecture and declarative syntax streamline development, making it a popular choice for building efficient and user-friendly interfaces.

I leverage Next.js for web development, capitalizing on its server-side rendering capabilities and optimized performance. For cross-platform mobile apps, I rely on Expo to rapidly build native-like experiences across iOS and Android using a shared JavaScript codebase.

To enhance the design and styling of my React applications, I utilize Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that provides a vast collection of pre-built classes for rapid styling. Tailwind's class-based approach eliminates the need for custom CSS, streamlining the development process and ensuring consistent styling across components.

### Backend

![nodejs](https://img.shields.io/badge/nodejs-5fa04e?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white) ![express](https://img.shields.io/badge/express-white?style=for-the-badge&logo=express&logoColor=black)

Node.js serves as a robust platform for backend development, enabling efficient server-side operations. Its non-blocking, event-driven architecture is well-suited for handling concurrent requests and I/O-intensive tasks.

Express.js, a popular framework built on Node.js, streamlines the process of creating web applications. Its minimalist and flexible design, combined with a rich ecosystem of middleware, empowers developers to build scalable and efficient backend services with ease.

### Web Server

Nginx is another powerful web server and reverse proxy server that can be used in conjunction with Node.js and Express.js to enhance performance and scalability.

### DevOps

![docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/Docker-2496ed?style=for-the-badge&logo=docker&logoColor=white)

Docker is a valuable tool for streamlining development and deployment workflows, regardless of whether you're working on monolithic or microservices architectures. Its containerization technology ensures consistent environments, simplifies dependency management, and facilitates collaboration among development teams.

## Networking

As a seasoned network engineer with three years of experience in the ISP sector, I specialize in network planning and device configuration. My expertise encompasses a diverse range of networking equipment, including routers and switches from MikroTik and Juniper, as well as OLTs from ZTE and switches from BDCom. I possess a strong proficiency in BGP configuration, load balancing, and failover strategies, ensuring network resilience and optimal performance.
